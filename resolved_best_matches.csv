Gennem sport lærer man desuden at håndtere modgang, sætte sig mål og fejre succeser – kvaliteter der er værdifulde i både arbejdsliv og privatliv. Holdsport som fodbold, håndbold, basketball eller volleyball bygger på tæt samarbejde, kommunikation og en fælles strategisk forståelse. Alle spillere skal løfte i flok, og i mange klubber følger der en hel kultur med tilhørende traditioner, fanmiljøer og sammenhold. Både på professionelt og amatørniveau giver sport mennesker en følelse af at høre til et sted – uanset alder, køn og baggrund. Også inden for individuelle sportsgrene, såsom tennis, golf, atletik eller svømning, er der mulighed for et stærkt socialt fællesskab. Man træner sammen, deler erfaringer og støtter hinanden i jagten på bedre personlige rekorder. Hertil kommer, at mange store sportsbegivenheder ikke kun samler aktive udøvere, men også tilskuere, hvilket i sig selv skaber en særlig stemning, der knytter folk sammen.",Spectator Sports | Junior Boys | Club Management | Club Shop | Sports & Clubs | Club Overview | Club Sets | Group Coaching | Club History | Sports Rules,711211.0,Sports Teams and Clubs,,,"Sports & Leisure - Clubs, Fields & Pitches",Sports,"Arts, Entertainment & Recreation",Leisure Facilities,SV-LF,Hospitality & Recreation,SV.2,Services,SV,7941,Professional Sports Clubs and Promoters (professional sports clubs),,9312,Activities of sports clubs,93.12,Activities of sports clubs,,4553760222.0,+4521062025 | +4540642065 | +4540432050 | +4522138180 | +4540762860 | +4520250303 | +4520172008 | +4553860222 | +4553760222 | +4521526020 | +33970440816 | +4576409409 | +351291701900,mia75madsen@gmail.com,,,https://www.holdsport.dk/,holdsport.dk,dk,da,https://www.facebook.com/holdsport/,https://twitter.com/holdsport,https://www.instagram.com/holdsport/,https://www.linkedin.com/company/holdsport,https://itunes.apple.com/dk/app/holdsport/id585251235?mt=8,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.holdsport,https://www.youtube.com/c/holdsporthelp,,caching: rackcache | javascript libraries: lodash | javascript libraries: core-js - 3.32.0 | analytics: facebook custom audiences | javascript libraries: tippy.js | analytics: ahoy | miscellaneous: popper | web frameworks: ruby on rails | issue trackers: new relic | web servers: empathy platform | appointment scheduling: calendly | javascript libraries: lodash - 1.4.4 | analytics: google universal analytics | programming languages: elixir | widgets: css | programming languages: ruby | ui frameworks: animate.css | cdn: cdnjs | javascript frameworks: lo-dash | font scripts: google font api | javascript libraries: modernizr | cache tools: rackcache | javascript libraries: jquery ui - 1.10.4 | javascript frameworks: moment.js | cms: site.com | font scripts: adobe fonts | widgets: facebook | javascript libraries: moment.js - 2.5.1 | font scripts: typekit | advertising networks: google doubleclick for publishers (dfp) | javascript libraries: select2 | retargeting: facebook custom audiences | network devices: html | miscellaneous: jquery easing | cdn: jsdelivr | javascript libraries: jquery ui | javascript frameworks: jquery migrate | javascript frameworks: modernizr | javascript libraries: parsley.js | network devices: html5 | programming languages: erlang | javascript libraries: jquery - 1.12.4 | miscellaneous: facebook | javascript frameworks: fancybox | javascript frameworks: jquery ui | retargeting: google doubleclick for publishers (dfp) | javascript libraries: fancybox | advertising networks: doubleclick for publishers (dfp) | tag managers: google tag manager | miscellaneous: linkedin | analytics: facebook analytics | javascript libraries: jquery | dev tools: new relic | retargeting: facebook | web frameworks: phoenix framework | widgets: javascript | analytics: jstimezonedetect | javascript frameworks: select2 | cdn: cloudflare | ui frameworks: animate.css - 4.1.1 | analytics: google analytics - UA | javascript libraries: jquery migrate | analytics: new relic | javascript libraries: moment.js | web frameworks: phoenix liveview | miscellaneous: instagram | javascript frameworks: jquery | analytics: google analytics,2019-11-24T11:02:33.000Z,2025-04-10T05:36:26.000Z,0.7692307692307693,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,holdsport.dk,1.4192307692307693,False,False,dk,dk,False,aarhus,aarhus,False,8000,8000,False,False,High,MATCHED,acbf3216-93e4-11eb-a746-fdabd18be9c6,Holdsport,holdsport.dk,DK

It was established as a fully state-owned stock holder's company in 1995 following political liberalization efforts. Post Danmark had taken over the mail delivery concession of its predecessor, the governmental department Postvæsenet, which was established in 1624. Post Danmark A/S was turned into a public limited company in 2002. In 2005, 22% of the company shares were sold to CVC Capital Partners, 3.5% of the company shares were partly sold to employees at a discount, partly kept in reserve for a management incentives program. In 2009, it was merged with the Swedish Posten AB to form PostNord, a joint postal service company between Denmark and Sweden. As of 2007, Post Danmark employed about 21,000 people, and delivered approximately a billion letters and 37 million parcels every year. Post Danmark has a wide variety of services, such as express deliveries (ensured delivery by no later than 9 am the following morning), courier services, facility services, 10 o'clock service (ensured delivery no later than 10 am every day), and electronic mailbox (mail scanned electronically and sent by email instead of by regular post).",E-commerce | Postal Service | Courier Service | Transportation & Logistics | Third-party Logistics,491110.0,Postal Service,492110.0,Couriers and Express Delivery Services,Postal Service,"Warehousing, Logistics & Support",Transport & Warehousing,Air Freight & Logistics,TR-AF,Air Transportation,TR.1,Transportation,TR,7389 | 4311,"Business Services, NEC (post office contract stations) | United States Postal Service",,5310,Postal activities,53.1,Postal activities under universal service obligation,,4526663903.0,+4520241209 | +4570218075 | +4570101300 | +4526663903 | +4520241127 | +4520241206 | +4520241123 | +4570707605 | +4520241031 | +4570602230 | +4550009999 | +4520220505,dkkundeservice@postnord.com,,,https://www.postnord.dk/,postnord.dk,dk,da,https://www.facebook.com/PostNordDK/,https://twitter.com/postnorddk,https://www.instagram.com/postnorddk/,https://www.linkedin.com/company/post-danmark,https://apps.apple.com/dk/app/id396871673,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=se.postnord.private,,,javascript frameworks: socket.io | performance: azure monitor | javascript libraries: lodash | javascript frameworks: requirejs | ui frameworks: pure css | analytics: microsoft application insights | ui frameworks: bootstrap | paas: azure | web servers: empathy platform | web frameworks: bootstrap | miscellaneous: webpack | javascript libraries: slick | issue trackers: sentry | ssl/tls certificate authorities: digicert | miscellaneous: parcel | widgets: css | javascript libraries: lazysizes | web frameworks: microsoft asp.net | javascript frameworks: react | miscellaneous: pwa | miscellaneous: onetrust | a/b testing: google optimize 360 | cache tools: varnish | security: hsts | reverse proxies: nginx | miscellaneous: http/3 | video players: youtube | miscellaneous: optanon | databases: mysql | javascript frameworks: sweetalert | javascript frameworks: moment.js | cms: site.com | miscellaneous: open graph | web frameworks: pure css | javascript libraries: sweetalert | cookie compliance: onetrust | network devices: html | miscellaneous: jquery easing | cdn: jsdelivr | font scripts: font awesome | javascript libraries: jquery ui | operating systems: windows server | ecommerce: magento | seo tool: facebook friendly | programming languages: node.js | cms: optimizely content management | javascript frameworks: slick | network devices: html5 | analytics: azure monitor | ecommerce: cart functionality | web servers: iis | tag managers: google tag manager | ui frameworks: civictheme | javascript libraries: jquery | widgets: javascript | rum: microsoft application insights | seo tool: twitter friendly | web servers: nginx | cdn: cloudflare | programming languages: php | javascript libraries: jquery migrate | performance: lazysizes | reverse proxy: f5 bigip | javascript libraries: moment.js | javascript frameworks: jquery | javascript libraries: matter.js | analytics: google analytics,2019-11-24T10:47:14.000Z,2025-04-04T11:44:14.609Z,0.8421052631578947,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,postnord.dk,1.3921052631578947,False,False,dk,dk,False,copenhagen,copenhagen,False,2450,2300,True,False,High,MATCHED,fac6c825-93e4-11eb-86dd-ffbd1b53140e,PostNord,postnord.dk,DK
