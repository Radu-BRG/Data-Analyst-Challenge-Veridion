I år 2007 overdrog vi laboratoriearbejdet til vores moderfirma Medico Chemical Lab ApS der i 2012 opkøbte hele DMA. Undersøgelserne retter sig primært mod situationer, hvor bygninger skal renoveres eller nedrives. Indeklimaproblemer herunder skimmel og PCB håndteres også i DMA, men er et selvstændigt problemfelt relateret til ophold i og brug af bygninger. Vi er et fagligt, bredt sammensat team med stor erfaring inden for analyseområdet og miljørådgivning til byggebranchen. Vi lægger vægt på et højt service niveau med hurtige resultater kommunikeret på en præcis og overskuelig måde. Vores kunder omfatter rådgivende ingeniører, arkitekter, entreprenører, offentlige instanser, nedrivningsfirmaer, asbest- og saneringsvirksomheder, private husejere mv. Med analyser for især asbest og skimmelsvamp startede DMA ud som et specialiseret laboratorium med fokus på miljøområdet.

Jolla was founded in 2011 by former Nokia staff of the MeeGo project team to use the MeeGo opportunities and its ""endless possibilities"". Pronounced 'yolla', the company name is Finnish for ""dinghy"" (a small agile boat or life rescue boat) and it refers to the possibility for the company to compete against giants like Samsung and Apple pictured in antithesis as big cruise ships. Then, the community and the media used the name as an ironic joke about the ""burning platform"" memo, which contained the metaphor ""jump into the cold sea water"" or ""burn with burning platform"" used in context of the Nokia business activities. In 2024, to escape Russia's investors due to the Ukrainian war, the Jolla initial company filed for bankruptcy, continuing its activity under the JollyBoys name.",Linux Operating Systems | Sailfish OS | Mobility Solutions | Smartphones & Tablets | Embedded Linux,513210.0,Software Publishers,,,Mobile App Agencies,Software & IT Services,IT&C Services,Software & IT Services,TC-SI,Technology,TC.1,Technology & Communications,TC,7372,Prepackaged Software (software publishing),Engineers | Wholesale - Hardware / Plumbing Supplies / Electrical Supplies | Architects | Retail - Electronics (Install / Repair Off Premises) | Software Developers (Pre-Packaged),5820,Software publishing,58.21 | 58.29,Publishing of computer games | Other software publishing,891601 | 509201 | 891501 | 571801 | 891801,,,info@jolla.com,care@jolla.com | info@jolla.com | partners@jolla.com,,https://jolla.com/,jolla.com,com,en,https://www.facebook.com/jollaofficial/,https://twitter.com/jollahq,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/jolla,,,https://www.youtube.com/user/jollaofficial,,web servers: ibm websphere application server | cookie compliance: cookie control | miscellaneous: babel | ssl/tls certificate authorities: aws certificate manager | javascript libraries: core-js | miscellaneous: rss | ui frameworks: bootstrap | lead generation: adroll | miscellaneous: popper | web servers: empathy platform | web frameworks: bootstrap | javascript libraries: swiper | security: recaptcha | seo: yoast seo | widgets: css | cache tools: w3 total cache | miscellaneous: twitter emoji (twemoji) | paas: amazon web services | advertising networks: adroll | miscellaneous: pwa | javascript frameworks: jquery mousewheel | font scripts: google font api | security: hsts | blogging platforms: wordpress | javascript libraries: modernizr | analytics: plausible | databases: mysql | issue trackers: really simple discovery | miscellaneous: touchswipe | cms: site.com | javascript libraries: prettyphoto | miscellaneous: open graph | seo tool: yoast seo | miscellaneous: swiper slider | network devices: html | miscellaneous: jquery easing | font scripts: font awesome | javascript libraries: jquery ui | retargeting: adroll | javascript frameworks: jquery migrate | wordpress plugins: w3 total cache | javascript frameworks: modernizr | seo tool: facebook friendly | network devices: html5 | miscellaneous: facebook | javascript frameworks: prettyphoto | cms: wordpress | blogs: wordpress | javascript frameworks: jquery ui | caching: w3 total cache | programming languages: python | lead generation: mailchimp | tag managers: google tag manager | miscellaneous: linkedin | javascript libraries: isotope | cookie compliance: cookiebot | web frameworks: jquery waypoints | javascript libraries: jquery | widgets: javascript | web frameworks: django | font scripts: twitter emoji (twemoji) | seo tool: twitter friendly | wordpress plugins: yoast seo | programming languages: php | marketing automation: mailchimp | javascript libraries: jquery migrate | javascript frameworks: jquery | analytics: google analytics,2019-11-24T10:48:02.000Z,2025-04-04T11:44:14.609Z,0.2962962962962963,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,jolla.com,0.6962962962962963,False,True,fi,fi,False,tampere,helsinki,True,33210,,False,False,2

Why a Wire Bot. When one needs to move a tool or a manipulator around, options are limited and have different drawbacks:Arms are strong and fast, but have a limited range. Wheeled robots have a long range but require either a controlled environment or a way to map an area and plan for a route. Multicopters can attain a huge volume but have a limited strength and can be hard to position and stabilize, especially in outdoor conditions. A suspended robot can move within a big volume, deploy more strength than a quadcopter and position itself more easily, depending less on sensors to achieve precision positioning. In several scenarios they are easier to deploy and design than competing approaches.
